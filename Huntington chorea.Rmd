.pull-left[The number of possible functionality of the HTT protein and the lack of understanding of the need for a set number of Glutamine repeats forces us to think of strategies that would locally abrogate the *expanded* polyQ regions without affecting the normal protein.]

# Not the full story

![](2016rt.png)

--
- ZNF strategy induced contractions but also expansions. 

--
- Cas9 Double Stranded Breaks (DSB's) induce more contractions but still a high level of expansions observed.

--
- Cas9 D10A nickase strategy induced high level contractions relative to expansions as well as leaving the normal transcripts untouched.

# Precise editing in patient derived *IPSC's*

![](precise.png)

--
- The nickase strategy is effective in patient derived cells.

--
- Minimal off-target effects.
